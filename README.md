# APIsec_U

# What this Project Does:
  If you are just learning about this new instructional course "API Security University" hosted by Corey Ball, the author of the No Starch Press book, Hacking API, welcome!. If you haven’t checked it out, I highly suggest that you do. This project aims to install all the software & dependencies Corey outlines in his videos. Again, if you haven’t checked out his course, it can be found here: https://university.apisec.ai/

  I am in no way affiliated with the course or the course author in anyway. I do not profit from the course in any way. I just wanted to share my method for quickly getting my computer ready to follow along with the course. I cannot offer any assistance with the course. This is a pretty basic script but, as always, use with caution as I offer no legal or financial responsibility for you using this software.

  Best used on linux machines.
# Why this project is useful:
  If you are like me, I use multiple computers, lots of Virtual Machines, and cloud machines. For my particular use case I am familiar with the installation of the tools and dependencies. I wanted a quick and easy way for me to spin up a VM or instances and start following along. If this fits your particular use case, then by all means, use this tool. If you are new to all this then I suggest you use the video and watch the step by step procedures.

# Where to Get Assistance:
  Unfortunately I am a student of the Cybersecurity trade as well, and by no means an expert, if you are having issues with this tool, then please research the best you can. I cannot, regrettably, assist in any issues you may face.
